### Useful resources

- [Object.values() from developer.mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values) - This helped me understand how to changed an object to an array. I really liked this website and will use it in the future.
- [Dark Theme z localStorage i CSS variables!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTX--uDIE9Y&ab_channel=Jakzacz%C4%85%C4%87programowa%C4%87%3F) - This is an amazing video that helped me understand how to save a recently used theme (light or dark) in the local storage. I would recommend it to anyone who is still learning the concept.
